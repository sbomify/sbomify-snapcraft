# sbomify-snapcraft

Generate SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) from Snapcraft YAML files.

## About

This tool generates SBOMs from `snapcraft.yaml` files, extracting information about source code dependencies that are compiled into snap packages. It is opinionated in favor of **CycloneDX** format and **JSON** output.

### What it does

- Parses `snapcraft.yaml` files to extract dependency information
- Identifies all parts with remote source repositories (git, tarballs, etc.)
- Extracts package names and versions from source URLs, tags, branches, and commits
- Generates a CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM in JSON format

### Important Limitations

This tool is **intentionally incomplete** by design:

- **Only extracts source-level dependencies**: It captures libraries and components that are compiled from source during the snap build process
- **Does not include runtime dependencies**: Stage packages and other runtime dependencies are deliberately excluded
- **Version information is best-effort**: Package versions are inferred from source references (git tags, branches, filenames) and may not reflect the actual built versions

**Technical Note:** This generates a **source SBOM** - documenting what goes into the build, not what comes out. It represents the declared dependencies in the snapcraft.yaml before the build process executes.

**Why these limitations?** Snapcraft uses `stage-packages` to pull in pre-built system packages at build time. The specific versions of these packages depend on the build environment and base image at the time of the build. Since we cannot know which versions will be installed until the snap is actually built, we cannot accurately include them in an SBOM generated from just the `snapcraft.yaml` file.

For a complete SBOM of a snap package (including a build SBOM or deployed SBOM), this tool should be used in conjunction with build-time introspection tools.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Process snapcraft.yaml in current directory (default)
uv run sbomify-snapcraft

# Process a specific snapcraft.yaml file
uv run sbomify-snapcraft path/to/snapcraft.yaml

# Output to a file
uv run sbomify-snapcraft snapcraft.yaml -o output.json

# Verbose mode (shows extracted packages)
uv run sbomify-snapcraft snapcraft.yaml -v

# Show help
uv run sbomify-snapcraft --help
```

## Output Format

Generates CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM in JSON format. Each component includes:

- Package name (extracted from source URL)
- Version (from git tags, branches, commits, or filenames)
- External reference (VCS source URL)
- Component type (library)

Each component includes:

- Package name (extracted from source URL)
- Version (from git tags, branches, commits, or filenames)
- External reference (VCS source URL)
- Component type (library)

## Example: Telegram Desktop

Using the [Telegram Desktop snapcraft.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/refs/heads/dev/snap/snapcraft.yaml) as a real-world example:

```bash
# Download the snapcraft.yaml
curl -o telegram.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/refs/heads/dev/snap/snapcraft.yaml

# Generate SBOM
uv run sbomify-snapcraft telegram.yaml -o telegram-sbom.json

# View with verbose output to see what was extracted
uv run sbomify-snapcraft telegram.yaml -v
```

**Example output (abbreviated):**

```
Snap name: telegram-desktop

Found 12 parts with source:

Part: patches
  Package Name: patches
  Version: 0b68b11
  Source: https://github.com/desktop-app/patches.git

Part: ada
  Package Name: ada
  Version: 3.2.4
  Source: https://github.com/ada-url/ada.git

Part: avif
  Package Name: libavif
  Version: 1.3.0
  Source: https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif.git

Part: ffmpeg
  Package Name: FFmpeg
  Version: n6.1.1
  Source: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git

Part: qt
  Package Name: qt5
  Version: 6.10.0
  Source: https://github.com/qt/qt5.git

... (7 more components)
```

**Generated SBOM includes:**

- 12 source dependencies compiled from Git repositories
- Package names extracted from repository URLs
- Versions from git tags (`v3.2.4` â†’ `3.2.4`), branches (`n6.1.1`), or commit hashes (`0b68b11`)
- VCS external references pointing to source repositories
- Metadata: tool information (sbomify-snapcraft), supplier, timestamp

**Not included (by design):**

- The `stage-packages` (gstreamer1.0-fdkaac, libgeoclue-2-0, etc.) - pre-built system packages whose versions depend on build environment
- The `build-packages` (clang, libboost-regex-dev, etc.) - build-time only dependencies
- Local parts with `source: .` - local source code being packaged

## Development

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

To add dependencies:

```bash
uv add package-name
```

To run the CLI during development:

```bash
uv run sbomify-snapcraft
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=sbomify_snapcraft --cov-report=term-missing
```

The project maintains a minimum test coverage of 80%.
